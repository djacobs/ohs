# TODO - IDEAS
# New Class: cat
# New Class: superhero
# New Class: Kibble Absorber
# - classes? (Knight, Demon, Archer, Wizard, Mechanic,fat cat) (a la Dom's exercise)


# TOURNAMENT! 
#  - one battle winner battles another battle-winner (and so on)
#  - the winner absorbs the losers stats
#  - We could also do 2 v 2 or 1 v 3

# Other ideas 
# - better stat sheets?
# - could characters have quirks?
# - different weapons?
# - potions?
# - monster fights (multiple fighters attack a monster?)
# - legendary monsters?
# - faster character creation?
# - level-ups?
