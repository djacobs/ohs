 - Want to include a `pip` package? Add it to `requirements.txt`!
 - To use all those cool packages, `import` them in `server.py`.
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
