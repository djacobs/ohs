# In Contest 

lev = Fighter("Lev", 3, 4, 4)
eli = Fighter("Eli", 5, 3, 4)
dom = Fighter("Dom", 5, 2, 4)

hurley = Fighter("Hurley", 5, 5, 5)

Getoutman = Monster("Get out man",50,50,50)


  
# eli.battle(lev)

# nitro.sheet()
lev.sheet()   


# Right now we can make Fighter and Monster
# We can sheet, attack, heal, 


# Other ideas 
# - better stat sheets?
# - could fighters have quirks?
# - different weapons?
# - potions?
# - monster fights?
# - faster character creation?
# - I think dexterity is too important right now ... we need to figure out how to make it less powerful! - DJ
